### Challenges with current e-commerce paradigm
E-Commerce domain has been dominated by few players across the world. This led to Morkal Concentration, Digital Monopolies & Economic Information Dissymen

- High entry barriers for new players
- Less control
- Increasing Cost of Operation for existing players
- Limited market access
- Information asymmetry leading to Limited avenues for buyers and sellers

## What is ONDC
ONDC, or Open Network for Digital Commerce, is an initiative by the Indian government to create an open and inclusive digital marketplace. It aims to reduce the dominance of large e-commerce companies by enabling small and local businesses to participate in online commerce. ONDC allows different e-commerce platforms to interconnect, so a user can see and compare products from multiple sellers across various platforms, all in one place¹². Think of it as a digital infrastructure that supports a more competitive and diverse online shopping experience³.
